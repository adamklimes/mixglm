Title: Model ecosystem resilience using mixture regression models
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Adam Klimes, Joseph D. Chipperfield
Maintainer: Adam Klimes <adamklimes3@gmail.com>
Description: The <b>mixglm</b> provides functions to fit mixtures of generalized linear models and tools to assess resilience using these models. Available are mixtures with gaussian, gamma, beta, negative binomial, and betabinomial distribution. Tools for postprocessing offer construction of stability curves and landscapes, identification of stable states and tipping points, and calculation of distances from observations to them. Visualization functions are available.
